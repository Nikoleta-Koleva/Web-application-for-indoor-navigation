# Project Title 
Buckingham Building navigation

# Project Description
This indoor navigation application was done as a part of my Final Year Project. Its aim is to allow
students to navigate easily towards reaching their tutorâ€™s room inside Buckingham building.
Currently, the development of the prototype will avoid requiring personal data and will work with
dummy user data. For future work, the application will ask users to sign up to Google in order to
access their timetable. The ethical, social and professional issues arising from the access of user
data will be managed by Google.

# How to Install and Run the Project
Run `npm install` (you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for that) to install the development server which will serve the `public` folder.

Once that command finished, start the server via `npm start` and view the app at [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

# How to Use the Project
You can login with your Google Account or as a Guest to access Buckingham building navigation. 
By logging in with Google, the application currently gains access to the user's email address and name. 
In future work, it will be granted access to their timetable.
