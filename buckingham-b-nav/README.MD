# Project Title 
Buckingham Building navigation

# Project Description
This indoor navigation application was done as a part of my Final Year Project. Its aim is to allow
students to navigate easily inside Buckingham building towards reaching their tutorâ€™s room.
Currently, the development of the prototype will avoid requiring personal data. 

For future work, the application will ask users to sign up to Google in order to
access their timetable. The ethical, social and professional issues arising from the access of user
data will be managed by Google.

# How to Install and Run the Project
Run `npm install` (you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for that) to install the development server which will serve the `public` folder.

Once that command finished, start the server via `npm start` and view the app at [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

The app is currently hosted by Firebase hosting on https://buckingham-building-navigation.web.app

# How to Use the Project
You can login as a Guest to access Buckingham building navigation. 
By logging in with Google, the application currently gains access to the user's email address and name. 
In future work, it will be granted access to their timetable.
